<h2>History</h2>
<p class= "background">I have been a fan of SF 49ers every since I have been a child. I remember
    when I was 7 years old and watched Steve Young win our last Super Bowl!
    The team has a very amazing winning history, and we have also have had 
    tough years. There was a space 2-4 years where SF 49ers were the class of NFL not
    that long ago. Though, we were amazing, we could not have secure another Super
    Bowl ring. This page is dedication of my support to the team!
